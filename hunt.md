##HTTP Response Scavenger Hunt

####Assignment

For this Lab you will be making HTTP requests in your terminal using **curl** and scavenging for data in the response you get back. **curl** is short for "Client for URL's" and is a tool that allows us to make HTTP requests in our terminal.

Find the response header  

  *1.* What was the Cache-Control?
  *2.* What value is after the key Expires?

Find the response body

  *1.* What year was your favorite movie released?
  *2.* What was your favorite movie rated?
